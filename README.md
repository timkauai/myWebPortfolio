# My Personal Website
This is the code I wrote for my personal website. Check it out [here](http://jamesdpratt.com)

## I wrote most of it with JS
I wanted to prove my knowledge with Javascript an OOP so I wrote some of the site as an application. 
Specifically when you first enter the site, and when you first enter the lab. On those sites, we save what button you press on and use that to show exactly what you want on the next page.


## I made some beautiful UI changes from before
I wanted my site to not only prove my Javascript ablities, but also my ablilties with UI and UX Design. I redesigned it from before to improve how clean the site was and the UX of the site
