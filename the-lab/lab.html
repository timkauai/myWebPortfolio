            <div class="img"></div>
            <p>This is a site I hacked together to look at every morning to review my day. It has a section for todays
                weather, todays surf, a slide show of pictures, a reminder for healthy habits, a new quote every day, a
                to-do list and a mail section with how many unread messages I have.</p>

            <div class="img"></div>
            <p>Simlar to my Mortality project, for english I had to make a work of art that could be used to answer a
                couple questions about success, as
                we were studying writing on success at the time. I wanted to use my new abilities with react.js, so it
                put it to use! I approached the assignment as if I was making a web app for a client. I hade 4 days ant
                this is what I came up with!</p>

                time. I had 4 days to make the site, and this is what I came up with!</p>

                job! I wanted to improve my JS skills before full on jumping into react and other framworks, so I coded
                this all with Vanilla JS, Design Patterns and OOP</p>
